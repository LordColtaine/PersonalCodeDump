-This is a bunch of stuff I did in 2021. The biggest project is the DirectXAnimation, which is a renderer which can load and play animations. I've used Open source references and ImGui to achieve this, but other than that this is all from scratch (which is built upon other projects in the repo, plus some references to other code, mainly hw3d. Can see the cloned repo in the root).

-Walkthrough is a simple "world" which has the basics of rendering and the camera can move around as per given input.

-Windows GDI is a mini paint project.

-There are some games done with SFML, which are Match3, Tetris, and Jump.

-The rest are threading, shared memory, design patterns and other basic C++ concepts.
